# IBU 063: Functional Programming

Welcome to the **Functional Programming** course repository! This course is designed for university-level students enrolled in IBU 063.

*This repository will serve the purpose of publishing solutions to the laboratory session tasks.*

## Course Description

The **Functional Programming** course provides a comprehensive exploration of key concepts, from an introduction to the benefits of functional programming versus object-oriented programming to advanced techniques such as currying, pipelining, and recursion. 

It provides insights into designing functions, ensuring purity through immutability, and implementing design patterns the functional way. The course also covers the influential role of functional programming in unit tests and introduces students to functional and reactive programming paradigms. 

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Develop a profound understanding of functional programming principles and practical applications. 
- Master the design of functions, ensuring code purity through immutability, and implementing design patterns in a functional paradigm. 
- Develop both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, enabling students to design elegant, robust, and scalable software solutions using functional programming principles.
